  # Image sizes (640x640 is maximum)
  img_size: [640, 640]

  # Heading indicates the compass heading of the camera.
  # Accepted values are from 0 to 360 (both values indicating North, with 90 indicating East, and 180 South).
  # If you don't specify a heading, a value is calculated that directs the camera towards the specified location,
  # from the point at which the closest photograph was taken. HOWEVER, THIS IS COMPUTED DYNAMICALLY IN THE CODE!
  heading: null

  # fov (default is 90) determines the horizontal field of view of the image expressed in degrees,
  # with a maximum allowed value of 120. When dealing with a fixed-size viewport, as with a Street View image
  # of a set size, field of view in essence represents zoom, with smaller numbers indicating a higher level of zoom.
  fov: 95

  # pitch (default is 0) specifies the up or down angle of the camera relative to the Street View vehicle.
  # This is often, but not always, flat horizontal. Positive values angle the camera up (with 90 degrees indicating
  # straight up); negative values angle the camera down (with -90 indicating straight down).
  pitch: 0
